## Section 1. Introduction

Sleep is often a point of contention for college students. While most would agree that sleep is important, external factors such as work, studying, and mental health can impact one's sleep schedule - and that's an issue.

Getting enough sleep is a necessary step for maintaining both physical and mental health, but that can often come in conflict with college and adult life. This project hopes to explore a sample of College Students who participated in a study on Sleep Patterns, and understand varying demographics' sleep behavior as well as how sleep correlates with **grades**,**mental health** and **cognitive function**  

## Section 2. Data Analysis Plan

Some questions that I hope to answer include:

- How do different demographics tend to sleep?

- How does sleep correlate with mental health?

- Can sleep have an effect on someone's cognitive function?

- How does poor sleep tend to affect grades?
